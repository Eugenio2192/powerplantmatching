# powerplantmatching
A set of tools for cleaning, standardising and combining multiple
power plant databases.

This package helps with simplifying the data collection of power
plants. Information on power plants, particularly European ones is
scattered over a couple of different projects and databases that are
based on different standards. Thus, we firstly provide functions to
vertically clean databases and convert them into one coherent
standard, that does not distinguish between aggregates the units of a
power plant. Secondly, we provide functions to horizontally merge
different databases in order to check their consistency and improve
the reliability.
