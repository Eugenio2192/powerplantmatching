# powerplantmatching
Set of tools to clean, standardise and  combine multiple power plant databases.

The modul is made up for simplifying data collection of power plants. Since power plant data bases have different standards concerning the classification of power plants and their fuel types, it can be a quiet a mess to put information from different databases together. Therefore we provide functions to vertically clean databases and put different power plant units together. Secondly, we provide functions to horizontally merge different databases in order to check their consistency and the reliability.
